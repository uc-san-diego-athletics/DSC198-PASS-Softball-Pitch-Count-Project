## Project Description:

Do our players struggle to find success in pressure situations?

The UC Sand Diego Softball coaches have been talking with the team about the importance of finding success in key situations, being late in at bats and with runners in scoring position. They have a strong feeling that the team is not doing particularly well in these situations. They want you to analyze the teams at bat statistics to give more insight to the teamâ€™s performance in these key situations.

## Key Learning Objectives

1.  Wrangle XML post-game statistics output to create usable event sequences with situational characteristics
2.  Identify successful outcomes through situational context (i.e., ground out v advancing runner with less than 2 outs)
3.  Create post game report for coaching staff that highlights key situational success rate.

## Secondary Objectives

1. Analyze historical data to understand norms for situational success.
2. Visualize contextual information regarding pitch type and pitch count.
